I am trying to deploy pyEnchant to pythonanywhere. If I get this to work I will script the process. However, if I can't get it to work, I will build my own spell checker library that just returns true or false if a word is spelled correctly. It will use solely python, and then there will be a java version that uses solely java. This is so that spellchecking doesn't depend on any C apis.
